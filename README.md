## 💡 The Idea

Every community has untapped potential.

Someone can fix a bike.  
Someone needs help moving.  
Someone offers language lessons.

But these needs and skills rarely connect.

**CommuneXR transforms a neighborhood into an interactive support network.**

---

## 🗺️ Core Features

✅ **📍 Interactive map** (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) with custom markers  
✅ **➕ Create a service** (Offer or Need) with category selection  
✅ **🔎 Filter by type** (offers/needs) **and category** (real-time search)  
✅ **👤 Simple authentication** (DemoUser for the challenge)  
✅ **🏷️ Badge system** with 4 unique badges to earn  
✅ **🔄 Exchange tracking** with status (proposed → accepted → completed)  
✅ **📊 User dashboard** with stats, badges, and exchange history  
✅ **💬 Messaging system** integrated with exchanges  
✅ **🎮 Gamification** with points (10 per completed exchange)

## 🧠 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **👀 Browse** the map to see nearby offers (🤝 green) and needs (🆘 red)
2. **🔍 Filter** by category to find exactly what you need
3. **📝 Click** a marker to see details and message the person
4. **💬 Send** a message → creates an exchange proposal
5. **✅ Accept/Decline** exchanges from your dashboard
6. **🏆 Complete** exchanges → earn points and badges!

### Gamification

| Badge             | How to earn                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🌟 First Helper   | Complete your first exchange   |
| 🏡 Good Neighbor  | Complete 5 exchanges           |
| 🦸 Community Hero | Complete 10 exchanges          |
| 🔧 Skilled Helper | Help in 3 different categories |

Plus:

- ⭐ **10 points** per completed exchange
- 📈 Badges unlock automatically via Rails callbacks
